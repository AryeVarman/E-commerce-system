Electronic commerce System made by myself and Noam Cohen for school as first object oriented project.

The system simulates an electronic commerce system that has sellers and buyers and allows you to do various of actions. such as signing new users to the system, adding new products to seller, search and order products for a buyer, displaying the system's products and users and more. all possible actions of the system are described in the interface file menu print function.
